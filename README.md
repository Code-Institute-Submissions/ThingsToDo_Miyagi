# Come n Play Miyagi

This project is created for my second milestone project for Code Institute to showcase what I have learned from Interactive Frontend Development course , 
creating a responsive and interactive website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and designed for those who would like to explore Miyagi Prefecture, 
located in the north east of Japan, and to offer useful tourist information, such as some activites and attractions to help users' travel decisions.

 
## UX

This site is designed to provide useful tourist information about Miyagi Prefecture where I come from. 
It may be reflected by my own personal experience but yet the goal of this site is 
to achieve an interactive and responsive website that users can easily navigate themselves across the site. 
The users can be redirected to external website for more details for their choice of activities.

### Site ownerâ€™s goals

- To encourage people to visit Miyagi and help to boost local businesses
- To have return customes, offering user friendly interactive and simple and clear website
- To help users make a decision for holiday destinations

### User stories

- As a first-time visitor, I expect the website will be simple and straightforward to find locations of activities.
- As a parent, I would like to find out about family-friendly places or places that both adults and children can enjoy at the same time.
- As a residence of Miyagi prefecture, I would like to know more about what other cities and towns offer.
- As a user, I should be able to use the filter of a type activities that I am looking for. 

### Design
