# Come n Play Miyagi

This project is created for my second milestone project for Code Institute to showcase what I have learned from Interactive Frontend Development course , 
creating a responsive and interactive website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and designed for those who would like to explore Miyagi Prefecture, 
located in the north east of Japan, and to offer useful tourist information, such as some activites and attractions to help users' travel decisions.

 
## UX

This site is designed to provide useful tourist information about Miyagi Prefecture where I come from. 
It may be reflected by my own personal experience but yet the goal of this site is 
to achieve an interactive and responsive website that users can easily navigate themselves across the site. 
The users can be redirected to external website for more details for their choice of activities.

### Site ownerâ€™s goals

- To encourage people to visit Miyagi and help to boost local businesses
- To have return customes, offering user friendly interactive and simple and clear website
- To help users make a decision for holiday destinations

### User stories

- As a first-time visitor, I expect the website will be simple and straightforward to find locations of activities.
- As a parent, I would like to find out about family-friendly places or places that both adults and children can enjoy at the same time.
- As a residence of Miyagi prefecture, I would like to know more about what other cities and towns offer.
- As a user, I should be able to use the filter of a type activities that I am looking for. 

### Design

This wireframe was made with MockFlow. The link below take you to PNG file.

## Features
 
### Existing Features
- A responsive navigation bar that changes to a hamburger menu on smaller screen
- A filter function on Activities page to help users to find activities that they are looking for
- Google Map with markers for users to locate activities easily
- A contact form which allows users to interact the site owner

### Features Left to Implement
In the future I would like to add below the followings which I think it would be beneficial for the website 
to have more traffic;

1. Sightseeing page
2. More family friendly places
3. Food page (ex: introduction of local delicacies)
4. Trip suggestions


## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript & jQuery
- Bootstrap
- GitHub
- Google Map
- MockFlow: frameworks 
- 
- any other tools (For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.)
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
